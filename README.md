# Customer Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Term Deposits
This project involves the analysis of a dataset from a major bank in the Middle East, which includes customer information and transaction data. The goal is to create predictive models to identify customers most likely to take a term deposit based on their profiles and transaction history.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer data and building predictive models to identify customers who are likely to opt for term deposits (fixed deposits). The analysis is based on a real-world dataset and aims to assist in targeted marketing strategies.

Key tasks include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation
- Visualization of results

## Files in the Repository

- **Customer Analysis PPT.pptx**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the analysis and findings.
- **Customer Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- **Customer_Data.csv**: The dataset containing customer demographic information.
- **Transaction_Data.csv**: The dataset containing transaction details of customers.
- **Data_Dictionary.csv**: A file describing the data fields in the `Customer_Data.csv` and `Transaction_Data.csv`.
- **LICENSE**: The license under which this project is distributed.
- **README.md**: This README file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Data Description
The project uses two main datasets:

1. **Customer_Data.csv**: Contains customer demographics, including:
   - `Customer_number`: Unique identifier for each customer
   - `age`, `job`, `marital`, `education`, `Annual Income`, `Gender`
   
2. **Transaction_Data.csv**: Contains transaction details, including:
   - `Customer_number`: Corresponds to the customer in the `Customer_Data.csv`
   - `Insurance`, `balance`, `housing`, `loan`, `contact`, `duration`, `campaign`, `last_contact_day`, `previous`, `poutcome`, `Term Deposit`, `Count_Txn`

## Installation

To run the analysis and models in this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Customer-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling-for-Term-Deposits.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Customer-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling-for-Term-Deposits
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Customer\ Analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to explore the data, build models, and visualize results.

## Results

The analysis and modeling results, including key insights and model performance metrics, are summarized in the `Customer Analysis PPT.pptx` file. The notebook provides detailed steps and code to reproduce the results.
